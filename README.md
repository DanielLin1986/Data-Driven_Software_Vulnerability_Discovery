# Data-Driven Software Vulnerability Discovery (SVD)

Data-driven vulnerability discovery using pattern recognition and machine learning (ML) provides alternative solutions for automated and potentially more efficient software vulnerability discovery. Particularly, The booming of the open source software community has made vast amounts of software code available, which allows machine learning and data mining techniques to exploit abundant patterns within software code. This repository lists the technical papers, developed tools and surveys of the Cyber Code Intelligence Research in the NSCLab, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia.
