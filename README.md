# Data-Driven Software Vulnerability Discovery (SVD)

Data-driven vulnerability discovery using pattern recognition and machine learning (ML) provides alternative solutions for automated and potentially more efficient software vulnerability discovery. Particularly, The booming of the open source software community has made vast amounts of software code available, which allows machine learning and data mining techniques to exploit abundant patterns within software code. This repository lists the technical papers, developed tools and surveys of the Cyber Code Intelligence Research in the NSCLab, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia.

## Technical Papers

 * Environments -- Please refer to [required_packages.txt](https://github.com/DanielLin1986/Function-level-Vulnerability-Detection/blob/master/required_packages.txt)
 * Hardware -- A GPU with at least 4GB RAM is recommended. Using CPU for training takes considerable time.
 
## Surveys

* The config folder -- containing the configuration file.
* The data folder -- containing the source code functions (vulnerable and non-vulnerable).
* The result folder -- containing the sample results.
* The src folder -- containing the code for model training and test.
